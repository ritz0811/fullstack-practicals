      <b>JavaScript</b>   is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to
        make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages,
        JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might
        use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing
        your Twitter feed. Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a
        static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages. Client-side JavaScript is
        the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the
        code to be interpreted by the browser. It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include
        programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content. The JavaScript
        client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might
        use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field. The JavaScript code is
        executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the
        Web Server. JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and
        other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
